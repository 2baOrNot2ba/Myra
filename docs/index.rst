Welcome to dreamBeam's documentation!
=====================================

dreamBeam is a framework for modeling radio astronomical telescopes.

dreamBeam let's you create generic measurement equations, which model
the spatial response (known as the beam) of a telescope during an actual
observation. It comes with some predetermined, basic beam models of real
telescopes, currently:

* LOFAR
* NenuFAR
* ALMA (under development)
